# Football-Transfer-Recommender
A football player suggestion project may be an invaluable resource for organizations wanting to find and recruit excellent players who would be a good match for their roster. The initiative can aid in the identification of undervalued players, the filling of positional voids, and the improvement of recruiting efficiency.This project aims to provide recommendations to clubs for players that are needed based on their requirements.

**TECHNIQUES ADOPTED FOR THE PROJECT**

In this project, various techniques were used to formulate, model and implement the football
player recommendation model based on variety of features such goals, passing type, defensive
actions etc.


• **Data Pre-processing**: • Data pre-processing is an important stage in machine learning
that entails converting raw data into a format appropriate for analysis and modelling. It
entails cleaning, converting, and scaling the data to remove any inconsistencies,

mistakes, or unnecessary information that may impede the machine-learning
algorithm's performance.

**Here are some examples of how data pre-processing aids machine learning**:
➢ **Managing missing value**s: Data pre-processing aids in the management of missing or
partial data. Because missing data can lead to biased and erroneous models, it is critical
to delete or imputation the missing values before training the model.
➢ **Feature selection and extraction**: Data pre-processing aids in picking and extracting the
most relevant characteristics for the model from the dataset. This can increase the
model's accuracy while decreasing its computing complexity.
➢ Data pre-processing also includes **scaling and normalising** the data to ensure that all
features are on the same scale. This prevents bigger magnitude characteristics from
dominating the study and guarantees that the model is not biased towards certain traits.
➢ **Encoding categorical data**: Although many machine learning methods require
numerical input for processing, datasets frequently include categorical data. Data preprocessing aids in the conversion of categorical data into numerical data that can be
analysed.


• **Exploratory Data Analysis**: In a football player suggestion project, exploratory data
analysis (EDA) is critical. EDA enables us to comprehend the features of the
participants as well as the underlying patterns in the data, which is required for the
development of an efficient recommendation system.


• **K-Nearest Neighbours**: The k-NN method is a prominent machine learning technique
used for classification and regression analysis. It is a non-parametric and lazy learning
method, which means it makes no assumptions about the data's underlying distribution
and does not require any training before producing predictions. Instead, it predicts
based on the similarity of the input data to the labelled data in the training set.

• **Random Forest**: Random Forest is a well-known machine learning technique that may
be used for classification and regression problems. It is an ensemble learning approach
that makes predictions by combining numerous decision trees. A random forest
constructs each decision tree using a random collection of features and a random portion
of training data. It is very accurate and has been demonstrated to work well on a variety
of datasets. Second, it is not affected by outliers or noisy data. Finally, it is capable of
dealing with high-dimensional data with a huge number of characteristics.


**CONCLUSION**
the project on football player suggestion based on player performance and playing style has the potential to deliver significant information for football teams throughout the player recruiting process. It is feasible to find players that have the requisite traits to fit into a certain team's playing style and increase team performance by analysing data from sources such as https://fbref.com/en/ and utilising machine learning algorithms. However, it is critical to remember the data's limits as well as the subjectivity of player rating. It is also important to remember that the final choice on player recruiting is frequently made by the team's management, who may have their own preferences and limits.
